(* <summary>
  Halton algorithm for low-discrepancy sequence.  For more details see chapter 8, paragraph 2 of "Monte Carlo Methods in Finance", by Peter JÃ¤ckel  - the correctness of the returned values is tested by reproducing known good values. - the correctness of the returned values is tested by checking their discrepancy against known good values.
